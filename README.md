Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
Loans are a major requirement of the modern world. By this alone, banks receive a major portion of the total profit. 
It is beneficial for students or any person to manage their education and living expenses, and for individuals to purchase various luxuries, such as houses and cars. 
But when it comes to deciding whether the applicant's profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not. Banks have to look after many aspects.

using key features like Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc.
